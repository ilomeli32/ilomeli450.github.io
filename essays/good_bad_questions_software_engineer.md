We all know failure is part of success. All the people we revere as "sucessful" have, at some point, had difficulty doing something. Like all things human, this probably required them to seek the help of others who might have the same question or others who might already know the answer. The life of a software engineer is made up of many questions and much answer-finding. How a software engineer goes about finding answers, however, is very crucial and there must be some attention paid to it.

Stackoverflow is an interesting questions and answers forum. There are no established guidelines that are official of any sort. The site is a beautiful orchestra of collaboration and community. Whenever a software engineer, or an aspiring software-engineer-to-be, has questions about programming, google will often direct them towards this helpful site. I myself have used stackoverflow to find the solution to many issues I've had in the past. I have also used other styles of forum postings before and have seen how a question's presentation can yield responsiveness.

Upon scrolling [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), one can see examples of questions that are pedantic and not insightful. These questions make the person answering them uninterested, and the person who initially had the question remains unfulfilled in terms of an answer and knowledge. I believe there are ways to ask questions that will benefit the person posing it and the person answering them. So does Eric Steven Raymond does too, a process he outlines in his [website](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) titled "How to Ask Questions the Smart Way." His outline details the process that can be overtaken before posting the question, how to pose the question itself, and efficient ways of answering them.

I kept Steven's tips in mind when scrolling Stackoverflow and I was able to easily spot "bad" questions. I am a stickler of the idiom "No question is a dumb question," it is nonsensical to think of someone as dumb for something they are clearly admitting they want to learn more about. However, I still believe there are questions that can be phrased in a "bad" way, or sometimes, there are questions that can be easily answered and should not remain questions for long. My second belief is one that Steven and I share. In the question posed below, a user is asking about sorting algorithms. His question is about a topic of computer science that is fundamental and elementary. He should want to know the answer to this, as it is a concept that is widely used in the discourse. Therefore, he is in a good place to be wanting to learn the answer. The person is not, however, asking his question in the most efficient, smart way. His question requires a simple google search. Sorting algorithms are some of the most covered topics on the internet. People have spent lots of time and energy explaining, descriving, and showing the sorting algorithms being used. He would learn more by doing the search and learning about WHY the algorithms are ranked in time complexity and the cases in which they are best used. By posing a "shallow" question he is depriving himself of a learning opportunity and depriving the community of insightful ways to answer. One can easily post a link to help clarify his confusion, however, without a clear ultimate goal of why the person wants to learn the information, it is hard to do something else.

Another question that reinforces the idea that there exist bad ways to ask questions is the one posed below.

<div class="ui large rounded images">
  <img class="ui image" src="../images/question2.png">
</div>

This question fails to firstly identify the issue, instead posting an ambiguous block of code and in the title of the question, blaming the issue on the programming language itself. His colloquial way of posing the question as if he's lounging telling a story is not engaging and reflects he has done nothing active of spending time figuring out the answer on their own. To better help himself and others, the person should first identify exactly what they want to answer. In this example, the person vaguely calls it a "little problem," when they could instead spend some time to idenfity that they are trying to implement selection sort. In this case, the person is better of looking for the many online-available examples.

There do exist questions that are so insightful and informative that the community engages with the material and both parties benefit. An [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-it-faster-to-process-a-sorted-array-than-an-unsorted-array) of that is shown below:
<div class="ui large rounded images">
  <img class="ui image" src="../images/question3.png">
</div>

Here, the individual is asking about a similar topic as the "bad" example questions above. He has carefully laid out the reasons for his questions, in other words, he has been able to effectively show his points of confusion. His confusion is portrayed as curiosity. This portrayal incites the helpful online community to share the curiosity and together find a solution to the puzzling material. The individual also shows ways in which he has tried to answer the question himself. Others would appreciate his attempts and also learn more about the question topic from his experiments. He summarizes the question by posing branching questions that seem to work as stepping stones for a solution. This helps break the question apart, so the answering audience can tackle specific parts.
The question has allowed the community to identify his confusion. It turns out he is getting at a bigger concept that the community helped him identify, something known as "Branch Prediction Fail." The ability for them to diagnose the issue can now lead to discussion about the concept and more examples of application. In the end, the person posing the question earns an answer and the online community learns about a concept and adds another example case.

As seen above, bad and good questions exist. It is in the interest of all parties involved in a question scenario that a question be laid out carefully, researched fully prior, and interesting to answer. These simple steps can make an engaging environment where all parties partake in learning and growing.
