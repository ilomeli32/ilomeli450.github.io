A son of immigrant parents steps onto the campus of an elite liberal arts institution. Quickly, the 11 AP classes blur against $50k high school education price tags. In high school, he felt taking the highest level classes would help further him. Never did it occur that elsewhere, there were people with better resources receiving better quality instruction on the same topics.  He is no longer alike 96% of his school's ethnic population; in fact, he is now a minority. He hears Spanish words from his international classmates as they talk about their abroad experiences. Class registration begins and his big aspirations reflect the size of his parent's sacrifices. He feels the pressure to be the family's next monetary supplier. "Perfect, an engineer it is," he thinks as he registers for courses. He then recalls his heart and passion - making an impact. He thinks of law. He considers International Relations, but he remains on the engineering track.

That student is me, fresh from high school, making the decision to pick a major that will fulfill my personal needs as well as give back to my family's sacrifices." It would be perfect if I was wired to be a technical machine, perfecting my analysis of electrical circuits and learning about control systems and hardware. It would also be perfect if I could find a part of law that blended my interests in STEM. Instead of figuring it out, I spent copious amounts of time in the computer lab. Brand new to the subject, my computer science class fascinated me the most. I knew I wanted to be part of the discourse. I found the solution to my dilemma. The idea that I could pursue my interests while fulfilling my role as provider for my family was exciting.

The professor asked which languages we knew. I grew up learning Spanish, learned English, and took French in high school. I was used to being told I was good at learning languages. When the professor asked which languages we knew, I was excited to show that my knowledge of languages could correlate to my ability to adapt in the introductory computer science course. I was confused when he mentioned language names like Ruby and many hands went up. I had never heard of the language Ruby, less 'Java' that came after, or 'Python' that followed. My eager hand was left mid-raise, my feelings of inferiority ran rampant surrounded by a class of polyglots

I was used to being new. I integrated American Society at the age of eight, when my family moved to Southern California from Mexico. I walked onto my college varsity swim team after four years of being on the inaugural high school team. I was the first in my family to leave the state for college. Feeling new in this class was not new to me, but different. I knew I wanted to be part of it: I felt that I belonged. Even so, in an introductory class, I somehow felt disadvantaged. I began thinking of dropping the course; after all, that was the advice I read on guides for college freshmen. I was illiterate in computer science amidst a sea of polyglots. The will to become a computer scientist was there, but, the confidence was not. I excelled in the subject matter but felt estranged from talk about projects, stuff the majority of the class talked about. They were talking high-level implementation - I was still playing with learning blocks still and could not fathom speaking alike. 

It was my will to make an impact in society and my steadfast focus that kept me competent. I thought about the mobile application I could present my community that would solve the issue of legal rights violations during illegal ICE visits. I thought about the families that would benefit from my endeavors. I learned about neural networks and their extensive, dynamic properties that have transformed areas of computing. I was hungry to learn more, and that hunger has not diminished. The constant feeding of information keeps my mouth for knowledge agape. 

As a software engineer, I want to transform the lives of others using the powers of technology. I want to give other young boys and girls a chance to meet the incredible world I have had the priviledge of experiencing. I want to touch the communities I've lived in by implementing solutions to their plaguing issues. I have learned first-hand the power of technology and I hope harness it for a better the world. I want to use my polyglot skills to make interesting solutions, and who knows, maybe I will eventually merge my interests of law and computer science and learn the legal language.
